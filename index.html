            I am really excited about web development! I am fascinated by the incredible
            creative potential of programming. Within the wires and circuitry of computers
            we fashion new worlds unconstrained by the ordinary laws that govern the outside
            world. I grew up with electronics one might say. Nintendo was a big part of my
            childhood. I was born in March 1983. SUper-Mario was born that same June.

            I remember when Super-Mario 3 came out. My dad was living in this apartment in Fresno.
            I liked that apartment. It had new clean but soon to be destroyed (by his 3 small children
            children and their trusty side-kick Justin) carpet. And when we spilled birthday cake on the floor that
            night and Eli knocked over his orange sodaâ€”the ants emerged numerous and single file; trudging
            through an orange soda swamp towards birthday cake boulders obediently carrying their body weight in crumbs
            back to the queen.
            That is... until my father burst through the door, simple green in hand, "you motherfuckers" he cursed-
            to the ants of course. We stayed awake as long as we could and played Super-Mario 3 until
            pink clouds came peeking from the pale morning sky through the blinds into our empty apartment bedroom
            where we sat laughing to each-other as we recounted to one another over and over again the hilarious scene
            and repeated our father's oath upon the ants with tears of laughter in our eyes.

            Mariah was the first of us to play Super Nintendo. Eli and I had gone with our mom on a trip
            to Baja. Riah stayed behind. What had happened was that Dad's house got broken into
            and the TV and the Nintendo had gotten stolen. Once dad got the insurance money, he got us
            a Super-Nintendo. I remember talking to my sister on the phone and her telling me about it.
            First she told me about the burglary and how they took the Nintendo. I was horrified. Then
            she told me that we got a Super-Nintendo, and I could hardly contain myself. Super-Mario World
            still might be the best game ever created.
